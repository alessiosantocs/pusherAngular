pusherAngular
=============

Do you know [Pusher](http://pusher.com)? These guys made something easy to get your app real-time with a well designed set of tools.

I was using Angular so I decided Pusher to be my best friend to get my angularapp in another dimension.

This is a fresh repository, so it's a bit soon for you to get the hands on this stuff and make it work for you. But I promise in a few days I will fill it up with examples and exciting features.

Cheers!
