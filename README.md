pusherAngular
=============

Do you know [Pusher](http://pusher.com)? These guys made something easy to get your app real-time with a well designed set of tools.

I was using Angular so I decided Pusher to be my best friend to get my angularapp in another dimension.

##Introduction
Pusher is a actually a service (API+SERVER) that stands between two/more clients (devices) and delivers in real-time messages fired from one to everyone else and into a preset channel.

###Before you continue
I suggest you to have a look at the guide, at least at the introduction/basics section. [http://pusher.com/docs](http://pusher.com/docs)

##How does this module work?
This little module is designed to handle the client part of the communication and to manage an external API to handle the 'send message' part of the communication.

// TODO: my dream is to help you handle the 'push' part stand-alone. So you can use it apart from every server help. I count to do this soon.

###Configuration
<pre>
	do("example");
</pre>
